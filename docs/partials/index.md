## The Setup

Triggering the drawer relies on functions being installed. See the following example code that is installed into this demo.

```javascript
function toggleDrawer(drawerID) {
  const drawer = document.querySelector(drawerID);

  if (drawer.hasAttribute('open')) {
    drawer.removeAttribute('open');
  } else {
    drawer.setAttribute('open', true);
  }
}
```

Once the JavaScript is added to the scope of the experience, the next part is adding a trigger. In this example, the button component will toggle a drawer with the ID of `#demo1`.

``` html
<auro-button onClick="toggleDrawer('#demo1')">Open Drawer</auro-button>
```

## The Structure

The structure of the drawer itself consists of three slots. The `header`, `content` and `footer` slots. See the scaffolding example below for adding content to the component.

``` html
  <auro-drawer id="[unique ID]">
    <span slot="header">[header content]</span>
    <span slot="content">
      [body content]
    </span>
    <span slot="footer">
      [footer content]
    </span>
  </auro-drawer>
```

It should be noted that the footer slot is reserved for the placement of action buttons.

## Example(s)

<div class="exampleWrapper">
  <!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (FILE:src=./../apiExamples/basic.html) -->
  <!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->
</div>

<auro-accordion alignRight>
  <span slot="trigger">See code</span>

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (CODE:src=./../apiExamples/basic.html) -->
<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

</auro-accordion>

Having a closing statement about your example helps to really complete the thought with your reader.

## Recommended Use and Version Control

There are two important parts of every Auro component. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes">class</a> and the custom element. The class is exported and then used as part of defining the Web Component. When importing this component as described in the <a href="#install">install</a> section, the class is imported and the `auro-drawer` custom element is defined automatically.

To protect from versioning conflicts with other instances of the component being loaded, it is recommended to use our `AuroDrawer.register(name)` method and pass in a unique name.

```js
import { AuroDrawer } from './src/auro-drawer.js';

AuroDrawer.register('custom-drawer');
```

This will create a new custom element that you can use in your HTML that will function identically to the `auro-drawer` element.

<div class="exampleWrapper">
  <!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (FILE:src=./../apiExamples/custom.html) -->
  <!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->
</div>

<auro-accordion alignRight>
  <span slot="trigger">See code</span>

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (CODE:src=./../apiExamples/custom.html) -->
<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

</auro-accordion>
