# Drawer

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (FILE:src=./../docs/partials/description.md) -->
<!-- The below content is automatically added from ./../docs/partials/description.md -->
The `<auro-drawer>` component is an intrusive interactive component, not passive. The component is best used when there is a requirement the user be made aware of the content being shown, moving focus from the main content to the drawer content.

The component also supports a modal (blocking) state where the user must interact with the content of the component in order to continue. Passive dismissal of the content is not allowed. Users of this state must add a trigger for the user to move beyond this content.

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (FILE:src=./../docs/partials/readmeAddlInfo.md) -->
<!-- The below content is automatically added from ./../docs/partials/readmeAddlInfo.md -->
**Important Notice**: This component no longer lives within the `auro-interruption` repository, as that is now being deprecated. `<auro-drawer>` is now a standalone component and users will be required to install it seperately. See the [Install Page](https://auro.alaskaair.com/components/auro/drawer/install) for instructions on how to install the component.

### Design Token CSS Custom Property dependency

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (REMOTE:url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlaskaAirlines/WC-Generator/master/componentDocs/partials/development/designTokens.md) -->
The use of any Auro custom element has a dependency on the [Auro Design Tokens](https://auro.alaskaair.com/getting-started/developers/design-tokens).

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

### CSS Custom Property fallbacks

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (REMOTE:url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlaskaAirlines/WC-Generator/master/componentDocs/partials/usage/cssFallbacks.md) -->
[CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) are [not supported](https://auro.alaskaair.com/support/custom-properties) in older browsers. For this, fallback properties are pre-generated and included with the npm.

Any update to the Auro Design Tokens will be immediately reflected with browsers that support CSS custom properties, legacy browsers will require updated components with pre-generated fallback properties.

## Install bundled assets from CDN

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (REMOTE:url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlaskaAirlines/WC-Generator/master/componentDocs/partials/usage/bundleInstallDescription.md) -->
In cases where the project is not able to process JS assets, there are pre-processed assets available for use. See -- `auro-drawer__bundled.js` for modern browsers. Legacy browsers such as IE11 are no longer supported.

**WARNING!** When installing into your application environment, DO NOT use `@latest` for the requested version. Risks include unknown MAJOR version releases and instant adoption of any new features and possible bugs without developer knowledge. The `@latest` wildcard should NEVER be used for production customer-facing applications. You have been warned.
